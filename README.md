# Classic Algorithms

This repository is dedicated to sharing open-source implementations of classic algorithms in mathematics and computer science. The goal is to provide a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners interested in exploring and experimenting with these algorithms.

## Algorithms Included

Currently, this repository includes the following classic algorithms:

- [Ant Colony Optimization](https://github.com/StarLight1212/Classic-Algorithm/blob/main/Classic%20Mathematics%20Model/AntColonyOptimization.py)
- [Particle Swarm Optimization](https://github.com/StarLight1212/Classic-Algorithm/blob/main/Classic%20Mathematics%20Model/ParticleSwarmOptimization.py)
- [Simulated Annealing](https://github.com/StarLight1212/Classic-Algorithm/blob/main/Classic%20Mathematics%20Model/SimulatedAnnealing.py)
- Genetic Algorithm
- Particle Swarm Optimization
- [Cellular Automata](https://github.com/StarLight1212/Classic-Algorithm/blob/main/Classic%20Mathematics%20Model/CellularAutomata.py)
- [Monte Carlo Methods](https://github.com/StarLight1212/Classic-Algorithm/blob/main/Classic%20Mathematics%20Model/monte_carlo.py)
- Gradient Descent

Each algorithm has a separate directory containing the implementation code and a brief description of the algorithm.

## Usage

The implementations are provided in Python. To use these algorithms, clone this repository and install the required dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file. Each algorithm has its own script for running the algorithm on a specific problem. The script can be run using the command `python <algorithm_name>_example.py`.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome in the form of new algorithms, bug fixes, or improved implementations. If you wish to contribute, please follow the guidelines provided in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
